# Summary of Intro

## Copy the Inspiration

- If you're doing something exactly how someone else did it, you aren't innovating.
- If someone is listing activities and giving you a prescribed process, they aren't teaching you design.
- Being a designer is about how you think and how you see the world.

## What Makes a Good Designer

- Learning to accurately perceive the world, learning to see any argument from any point of view, and always being on the lookout for why you might be wrong.
- Being a good listener so that you really understand people and what makes them tick, why they do the things they do and what they need.
- Learning to be creative is about learning to solve problems in people's lives and by extension, problems in your own life.

## It's not about the Process

- All learning is either knowledge, process or concepts.
- Too many people teach design like it's all about learning a process because it's easy to teach a process, but it's all about the concepts.
- It's about knowledge a bit and hardly at all about process.
- Following someone else's activities and process like they do is a crutch.
- It'll help you get started, but it'll stunt your development pretty much instantly.

## Summary

- I want you to understand design, not just understand how I design.
- I want you to think for yourself.
