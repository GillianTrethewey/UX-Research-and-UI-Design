## High failure rate of product design

- 70-90% of digital products fail
- must take great care in designing a product
- must be smart to design better than large budget projects
- be careful about sources of advice and inspiration
- never lose sight of the fact you're going to fail

- in a company, everyone will be conscious about the importance of design and they need to be heard
- understanding people's problems, and their expectations, seeing things from both points of view, are things that make you a good designer and a good person
