# Make it Pretty

## Designers are not digital artists

- initial paradigms around web designers were that they were digital artists and just made the website look 'pretty'
- unfortunately, this was backed up by awards such as the CSS Design Awards
- awards may not be bad in and of themselves, but they sent a message reinforced by recruiters that the role was about prettifying the web

## Excitement over new tools

- rounded corners on boxes, gradients, fonts, colours - these were all exciting in the design world when introduced for the first time
- web 2.0 is a design style that referred to adding a drop shadow, rounded corners, textured backgrounds, and gradients to everything you could

## User Experience

- initially referred to how to make websites more usable (10 years ago)
- but today, when referencing older websites, the teaching is that by removing all the clutter, it's more usable and easier to read (and therefore better), so "let's make websites as bland as humanly possible"

## This teaching was wrong from 10 years ago

- the pendulum towards bland has swung way too far and what these teachings have failed to mention is if all you cared about was usability, you'd probably design for a 5 year old, where a button actually looks and functions like a button with a click sound on top

## Perception Research

- we will learn later that, perceptually, buttons actually make more sense with drop shadows and so on (skeuomorphic design vs. flat design)
- having a textured background makes us remember what we've read on it more

## Style was why web 2.0 was killed off - not usability

- early designers embodied this was of designing and sadly are now mentors

## Summary

We made some big mistakes in the early days of web design and certainly in the early days of UX design.

Sadly these mistakes got into our vocabulary and into our teams.
We never really addressed them to get rid of them.
