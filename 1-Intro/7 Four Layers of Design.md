## Outcome

Start with the intended outcome. What will the thing you're designing make easier or better for people? Most projects without a clearly defined intended outcome don't end well.

## Structure

Next design the system. Work out the required components to meet the intended outcome, and map the relationships between them.

## Interaction

After the outcome and system are figured out, design the interaction details. What are the micro-interactions? The sequences of behaviour and events? What are the UI components and how will people interact with or manipulate them? How will things move, change, or animate? Revisit the system, evolve it to match the interactions. Keep iterating.

## Visual

Once the outcome, system, and interactions are well defined and working, ideally prototyped, design the visual details. Make it look and feel beautiful, enjoyable. Now it's time for beautiful grids, colour, typography, iconography.

## Clay Christensen's Jobs framework

When _____ , I want to _____ , so I can _____ .

For example: When _an important new customer signs up_, I want to _be notified_, so I can _start a conversation with them_.

My Note: This sounds like user stories framed from the business' point of view.
