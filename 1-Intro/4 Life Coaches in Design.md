# Life Coaches in Design

## Similarities in design and life coaching

- Tony Robbins - Awaken the Giant Within - used 1953 Yale experiment of writing down goals - 3% of students doing this in a vivid way were more successful
- actually was taken from Zig Zigler and was not a study at all that could be verified as having happened
- but more recently this has been verified as being FALSE
- having vivid goals actually results in people applying for less jobs, having less success, and earn less money overall

## What actually does work for success?

- being more flexible
- having a little stress helps achieve our goals

## Damaging advice is everywhere for goal setting

- therefore it's damaging advice from life coaches
- there's a lot of rules and processes which keep getting promoted but are good stories, and so the incorrect practices keep getting taught and disseminated throughout society in books and blog posts

## Good Designer Skills

- improving creativity
- improving your communication skills
- improving your perceptivity

## Bad Designer Skills

- following someone else's process for user testing, for example, won't work
- it's like telling their lottery numbers after they've won - it only worked for the period of time in which they worked on the particular design at the time
- although it can help inspire you to talk about process, but 90% of blog posts will talk about process anyway

## Course will not prescribe systems for better design

- don't listen to people telling you systems
- ignore design quotes eg. If you have to explain it you've failed
- common quotes are misquoted anyway
- e.g. Icons enhance usability - they don't, but the text labels do
- e.g. Copy Amazon - it doesn't work because they are not like other ecommerce companies

## Summary

Some designers, like life coaches, will tell stories or rules they haven't really researched.
Prescribing a new failsafe process or activity so your app design can't fail.

New ones come up all the time and app designs fail all the time.

See if you can tune out the noise.
