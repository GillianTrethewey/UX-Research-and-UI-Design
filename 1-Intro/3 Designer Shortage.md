# Designer Shortage

## Rise in popularity of digital design

- iPhone popularity made design more desirable
- design interviews -  make it look like Apple stuff
- no one knew why they were hiring, no seniors, and no direction was the downside
- shortage today - FB will buy entire design company

## Mentors may be accidental

- mentors - but might just be in the right place at the right time, senior due to experience of 10 years
- feels like still no direction, but at least there's a history of web design to reflect upon
- iteration - learn from the past
- your mentors - who mentored them? if they studied design, then maybe they didn't study psych etc.

## Design is informed from many sources

- course will look at design history, psychology, politics, neuroscience
- we want to make sure we learn from a range of designers - not just digital product designers - those who might be from different industries

## Summary

There has always been a shortage of digital product designers.
Some people became senior designers in big corporations because they were in the right place at the right time.

So we want to make sure we learn from a range of designers.
Not just digital product designers.
