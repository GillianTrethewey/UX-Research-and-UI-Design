# Arrogant Design

It's become rather cliche at tech conferences that somebody will stand up to give a talk about user experience design, and they will start by showing you a ticket machine that they found hard to use or a TV remote that they believe has too many buttons.

Upon further investigation, it turns out they have done no research into TV remotes and they don't even work in the TV industry.

## You're in Uncharted Waters

This always reminds me of the first chapter of the first design book that was required reading for me at design school. This book started with a story, a story of an American fishing corporation finding a new wealth of fish in the Pacific Ocean near an island.

The islanders were catching fish in their thousands, and this fishing company said, Let's try and catch some fish here. Using all their knowledge from around the seas, they developed the perfect fishing hook to work at this depth, at this temperature with this current strength.

And they proceeded to catch no fish. In spite of all their experience and all the money they had spent. They caught nothing. They had completely failed to sail over to the island where for hundreds of generations they had lived from catching fish in these exact waters. This book referred to this as arrogant design.

## Someone Else Already Knows the Way

The name arrogant designer is absolutely perfect. Somebody who completely fails to do the necessary research to understand these waters. The islanders have iterated on that fishing hook every year, using designs from the best hook that they had before to inspire the future hooks so that they catch the fish The best. Arrogant design has been a scourge on the design world ever since.

## Arrogant Design - Thinking You Know Best

For now, I wanted to leave you with the description of arrogant design. When somebody tries to create something new without fully understanding the industry, expecting that their previous experience is more valid than other peoples.

## You Can Be an Expert or a Designer but never both

## Summary

The biggest enemy of design is arrogance. It stops us keeping our eyes open to see what is wrong with our current work.

Most of what you hear online and at conferences is naturally from arrogant designers. The real designers are letting their work speak for itself!
