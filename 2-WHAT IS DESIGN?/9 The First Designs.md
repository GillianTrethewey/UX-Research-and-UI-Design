# The First Designs

## Uniformity in the Chinese Army

- first design in history or first set of plans on how to build a product was from Qin Shi Huang 
- made a set of requirements for how every item in the army needed to be created incl. weight, tension of the string of a bow
- every archer could use every bow
- similarly the Romans also used specifications for swords and shields, armour and arrows

## Aesthetics, The Victors of Rome

- part of budget was spent on design appearance and decoration 
- uniforms and tools being the same created a sense of unity and pride
- fear and respect from enemies when saw them marching in unison
- sends a signal that this army can spend money on looking good and still win
- therefore some of the earliest design specs were more about emotion than utility (the experience of the soldier than utility of the items)

## Experience Drives Innovation

- Book of Ingenious Devices 800BC
- engineering capital of the world at the time - Mesopotamian area
- book included mechanisms that would later inform the creation of hydraulic systems, pumps, and the combustion engine
- but these mechanisms were created to make a toy elephant to squirt water out of its trunk (using a sophisticated pump system inside)
- most human innovation has come about because of emotional reasons, not because of utilitarian reasons
- the usefulness of items normally comes later
- human experience drives innovation!
## Summary

The first designs in history were to unite the armies of China and Rome.

The designs allowed them to work better as a unit, but also to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves.

Experiences drive innovation. It always has!
