## Different Definitions for Design

## Unsolicited Feedback

- if someone tells you how your process should be or what you need to do to design well, then they didn't first try to get complete clarity on what you're designing and for whom.
- they're pushing you around

- someone who takes the time to understand the design problem you're solving and for whom + experienced to guide you better is an incredibly valuable person in your professional life
