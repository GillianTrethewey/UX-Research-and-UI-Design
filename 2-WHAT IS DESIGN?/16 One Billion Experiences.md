# One Billion Experiences

## An App Doesn't Have an Experience

I'll often see people looking at an application and saying, I don't really like the user experience of this. I would change the user experience. It's my understanding that what they're saying is they would change the web application or they would change the design of the web application.

Not that they would change the user experience, mainly because an application doesn't have a user experience.That doesn't make any sense.

The person using it has an experience.

Even more confusingly, I see people look at websites and say it has a bad user experience, something I have no idea what they mean. I think they mean they don't like it.

## No Experience Here

The reality is a web application doesn't have an experience on its own.

If a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it doesn't make a sound. Well, probably.

But if a web application sits on its own in the woods, it doesn't have an experience. It needs a user, the user has an experience, and they're all different.

There's 7.5 billion user experience for every application.

## Your Experience is Yours Alone

There are some areas where we can assume people will have relatively good experiences and most people will have relatively bad experiences.

But if everybody had the same experience with everything, we would all have the same car and the same phone and would all wear the same clothes.

Why don't you have the same phone as your best friend? Because you experience them differently. If you ask the average person if they like iPhones, they'll tell you no. Most people don't like iPhones.

Does that make them a bad experience?
Well, that's the story we've all been telling ourselves, isn't it?

## Your Values are yours alone

That's what we've all been telling each other in the design industry.

But actually, your friend doesn't have a different phone to you because they experience it differently.

They have a different phone to you because they have different values to you. If someone buys a cheaper model of phone to you, it's not because they don't experience the extra features. Your phone has the same as you.

It's because they value the money they save more than you. If two people go on a luxury cruise, they'll probably both have quite positive experiences.

If two people spent time in prison, they would probably both have pretty negative experiences.

But I personally would probably enjoy a cruise less than most people because I value my freedom. I want to be able to travel around on my own.

This is a page from Alan Cooper's book about face.

These three different people have three different needs for cars and there's three different cars next to them. Now, if you were trying to sell the sports car, most of the people you speak to would say, I don't like the user experience of the sports car. I don't like it, I don't want it.

You shouldn't redesign it. That would be a terrible idea.

Of these three people, the first person values fun. The second person values safety and the third person values reliability. 

All three of them would experience the first car as being more fun.

The second car has been more comfortable and the third car has been more reliable.

They just don't all value the same experiences, the same.

To understand what people value, we need to speak to them, we need to interview them.

But to understand what they experience, we don't really we can actually predict quite accurately how

well people are going to experience certain things.

We can now even predict if people will enjoy how something looks.

But what we also know is our experiences change quite drastically because of different factors in our environment where we are, who we're with.

Sometimes they can be quite unexpected things in the environment.

Food tastes different because of the background noise in a restaurant, because of the amount of light in there.

When you make food for an airline, you need to put it on a plane and eat it before you know if it's any good.

You can't eat it on the ground.

The experience is different in the sky.

We can quite accurately guess how people are going to experience things, but we need to be in the exact environment, the exact setting that they would be in.

There are billions of different ways to experience a product, but the variable isn't necessarily to change the person experiencing it.

It can be to change the environment it's being experienced in.

Designers love showing these two home pages Google and Yahoo, and showing how Google is essentially Yahoo!

But they took all the rubbish off and saying, Well, maybe we should redesign Yahoo to make it like Google. That would be better.

No, it wouldn't. It wouldn't be better.

Yahoo has 1.85% market share in a massive market.

And let's face it, search engine optimization is a winner takes all market.

You're either good at search results or bad at them.

Yes, I know your granddad probably just still has Yahoo bookmarked and doesn't understand how to use Google. Probably.

But the absolute worst thing Yahoo could do would be redesign their home page and make it look like Google's because then why would anybody use Yahoo!

Even your granddad would be annoyed by that.

Yahoo.com gets millions of visitors a day because as tiny, tiny percentage of people like to see what the weather is when they're doing a search.

We're going to talk later about the rational 50s and 60s.

Back then, we had cartoons like The Jetsons that told us we eat food in pill form.

By now, they were so unbelievably wrong. Food is big, big business.

Cookery shows, restaurants, snacking, and yet there is nothing more utilitarian than nourishing your body.

You're trying to get the exact correct balance of vitamins and minerals into your body to power it the best you can, And we consistently fail to get the correct nutrients into our body because doing this incredibly utilitarian task, we decide we want a different experience.

## Human Fuel. If Only We Were Rational.

If you look at this act from the outside, it seems so obvious that a pill form of food is the best way to get that correct amount of nutrition into your body.

But if you try eating, you'll know in seconds that you want a cheeseburger.

The only time we came anywhere close to having a pill form of food was some weird powdered meals that hipsters in Silicon Valley started eating.

And that's precisely why the worst people, to get insight into user experience is Silicon Valley hipsters.

## Summary

A user interface doesn't have an experience without a user and there are 7.5 billion potential users. 

Each of those users values different things and experiences them differently in different context.

We can't predict what those experiences will be and we shouldn't underestimate their importance!

Remember how wrong people were when they thought we'd be eating pill food?
