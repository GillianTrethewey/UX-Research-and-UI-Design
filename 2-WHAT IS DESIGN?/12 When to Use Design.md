# When to Use Design

## Design - Planning The Big Things

- decide- plan-design-strategize ... the differences between these is what exactly is it that you are planning
- more specifically it's how important the decision is, and what activities you do to make the decision
- every time you have to make a decision, first make a decision about how important it is on a scale of 1-10
- e.g. deciding where to go for uni is 8/10 or 9/10, so you would put a lot of effort in to do a full range of research activities
- e.g. deciding where to go for lunch is 1/10 or 2/10, so just the first place you think of
- e.g. food restrictions or budgetary restrictions increase the importance
- someone who takes too long to decide where to go for lunch is putting too high an importance on something that isn't important

## Biases Save Us Time

- we rely on some past experience or hardwired programming to make decisions such as lunch
- we don't know the best place, but having a bias saves us time making the decision so we can decide really quickly
- otherwise we would spend all day picking lunch places
- most decisions are based on hardwired programming in our brain, some of them are subconscious

## Designers Create Their Own Recipes

- if you were creating your own restaurant, on the other hand, you would do a lot more research, and make unique things by researching still more food combos, and test them with people
- this is innovation because you're creating something new
- at some point you write the recipe down for other cooks and that is your documentation, that is your design
- The difference between choosing where to eat, choosing items for a menu or creating new items for a menu is the difference between deciding planning and designing.
- The real difference is how important each of those things are to you, and then what research and activities you have to do to check that they're good before you document the decision.
- When we design, it is like a very important decision that we want to do extra research in and we have to define the solution afterwards so that somebody else can create it.

## Summary

A design is like an important plan where we don't want to rely on existing solutions.

It's like creating a new recipe for an existing menu.

Most elements in our software won't be designed. They aren't important enough and we'll plan them from pre-existing solutions.
