# The Production Line

## User Experience

User experience is the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.

### Simplified to

User experience is the overall experience of a person using a product or service.

## User Experience Designer

So I suppose you would argue that someone whose job title is user experience designer is someone who is responsible for the overall experience of a person using the product or service. But this is not true.

This is just an employee. Everybody who works at a company is in some way responsible for improving the experience of someone using the product or service. And if they don't, then they don't need to work there.

## Documentation. Probably Most of Your Job

The division of labor that came about in Michael Thonet's time required the designs to be written down and explained in great detail so somebody else could fit them together.

The multiple divisions that have happened since means an entire design department can be designing one single product.

This requires a huge, much larger amount of documentation for all these people to be on the same page and to understand things the same.

If somebody had a job title like user Experience researcher, their entire job might be to understand the values and experiences of their users and document them in a way that it would help everyone in the company improve how they deliver the experience to those users.

For these reasons, anybody working in a design department, an increasingly larger amount of their responsibility is about how they communicate and document their findings or why they've made decisions in the design, which also means their responsibilities are getting much, much more specific and much narrower.

I've recently heard this referred to as the Mcdonaldization of design.

Michael Thonet was pretty much a craftsman who wrote down how to make the chair.

But a designer and a large corporation today is pretty much the person who squirts the mustard in the top of the McDonald's bun.

## Innovator or part of a big team?

The larger the team, the less responsibility the individual designer, but also the larger the corporation.

A larger corporation doesn't want to have a variable output. It wants to have a consistent output.

It doesn't want to make the best burger in the world one day and the worst burger in the world the next. It wants to consistently make average burgers.

The larger the corporation and the higher up someone is in that corporation, the more risk averse they are, the more they care about justification and documentation rather than innovation.

Throughout this course, I'm going to talk about both of these things, but it's important that you decide what kind of designer you want to be.

These are quite different designers and there is a certain quiet pride you can take in being reliable in being able to consistently produce things of a similar output, even if that output is average.

Michael Thonet didn't have the camaraderie and the enjoyment of working in a team. Neither did almost any of the designers I talk about throughout this course. They're all the innovators. They're not the ones who fit into a large corporation, but most of the reliable jobs are going to be for those reliable McDonaldized design workers.

So take some time to think about how much you want to be an innovator and how much you want to be a documenter in a production line of design.

Some designers like to work for a large corporation, but secretly do what they call guerrilla or undercover UX, where they go and research people's values and experiences and try and find innovative solutions off the clock in their free time so that they can present it and possibly get a raise.

## User Experience 

Lastly, I want to return to this definition of what user experience means.

The definition gave us two examples how easy or pleasing it is to use. I feel like largely people value one of these more than the other. A lot of designers when they say they're just talking about usability.

In fact, those analogies we saw earlier, the ketchup bottle and the path.

Those are two great examples of people thinking we're just talking about usability.

It's great that people are talking about usability, but if they think they're talking about user experience, then it stops them having an actual conversation about experience.

One thing you'll also notice is we work our way through the history books is that nobody ever designed anything without considering how pleasurable or easy it was for people to use.

I actually find it quite amusing when people say a user experience designer is a designer who is concerned about how usable and pleasurable a product is.

It makes me think, who exactly are these designers who aren't concerned about that? I've never heard of any of them.

It is, of course, impossible to design a product without also designing an experience. How could you possibly design a web application without also inadvertently designing the experience?

## Summary

Making products that are a good user experience has been a concern as long as there have been products.

As a designer you have to decide how much you want to be an innovator or how much you want to be part of a team. It's up to you. It can be rare to do both!
