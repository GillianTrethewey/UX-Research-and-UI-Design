# Wrong Rules

## Don't Bring Rules to Design. They Don't Apply

From time to time, people bring existing rule books to the wrong meeting. This happened a lot when websites were first invented and people started creating websites with no real understanding of how a website should be made. We started creating rules or guidelines based on other systems, other mediums, just like those fishermen in the last video.

## The Fold. Nothing to do with websites

One of my favorite examples comes from the news industry. Newspapers were very quick to take to the internet because they can update the news on their homepage even faster than they can with print. But now the incredibly overworked editor at the newspaper is a website designer.

These newspaper editors instantly brought with them a technique which makes absolutely no sense on a website, and they called it the fold. If you look at the newspapers in the picture on this newsstand, you'll see they're all folded in half and stacked next to each other.

You would never look at websites like this.You definitely don't get ten monitors and put them all on a screen. Load up the home page of ten different news websites and then look from afar to decide which one you're going to look on.

But newspaper editors in the 90s had no idea how people used websites yet. Newspaper editors referred to the part of the web page that loads on your screen before you scroll down as being above the fold and the part after you scroll down as being below the fold, insisting that all kinds of important content is shoved up to the very top of the screen.

Any of us with a little wheel in the middle of our mouse or any other way of scrolling easily, know that we scroll down straight away. In fact, often if I'm trying to read something at the bottom of my screen, I will scroll so it's in the middle of the screen because it's easier to scroll than it is to move or strain our focus to the bottom of the page.

It wasn't until the end of the 90s or even the start of the 2000 that people did tests and found out it made absolutely no difference whatsoever if something appeared above the fold or below the fold on a web page on loading.


## Clutter. Ruining websites since 1991.

The problem is it entered our vocabulary anyway, and it hung around until we started checking websites on our phones and different devices where it was almost impossible to tell what had loaded on the screen before we scrolled.

Now, if you were a web designer in the 90s and you were tasked with designing a news website, it would be arrogant of you to not go to the newspapers and learn how newspapers are designed.

So arguably, in the 90s, when people talked about the fold on a web page and shoved everything to the top of the site, it wasn't that big a mistake. We'll soon learn why that's just about the worst thing you can do for a design.

But where they made the mistake was that they took the rules that existed on newspapers and assumed it was a solid rule that applied everywhere else.

## There are no rules in design.

We have basic guidelines to help guide people in the correct direction.

When anybody tells you you have to have less than this many fonts, you have to have things appear at the top of the screen when it loads. When anybody says you have to do these things, do not listen.

There are no solid rules to design.
There are only suggestions and guidelines.

## Summary

Be careful of 'rules' in design. There are no rules, only guidelines.

Most of the time guidelines help, but sometimes they don't. 'The Fold' is an example of a rule we got wrong.

There are no rules in design!
