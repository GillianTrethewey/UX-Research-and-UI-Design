# What is Design?

## Michael Thonet Number 14 chair

- German Austrian man who created a chair called the Number 14 chair in 1859
- can go by different names depending on the country
- but how did it go worldwide

## Wood Steaming

- number 14 chair relied on a new technique called wood steaming
- steam allowed the wood to be molded into a new shape, which was stable when cooled

## Number 14 Chair The worlds first flatpack

- made up of 6 pieces of wood and 10 screws

- functional, strong, beautiful form
- simple and easy to make

## Divide & Conquer

- not the first mass produced item on the market, and not the first factory produced item by far
- but factory process was so simple that an unskilled person could learn to do it in a short period of time
- the pieces were so simple they could be shipped and assembled at the other end

## Michael Thonet

- prior to this, a single person would conceive and create a product
- he was a carpenter and created the chair when he was 63, which means he had a lot of experience of what makes a functional and beautiful chair
- but at this point, the designer conceived the chair and a factory worker created it, which was dividing the labour
- dividing the labour is argued about, but what's more important for this course is what happened when the labour was divided

## A Designer is a Planner

- designer specifies the structural properties of an object and it is created elsewhere
- therefore a designer is a planner
- e.g. fashion designer, chair designer, digital product designer, all create the plans but then someone else creates it
- We can think of the word design as being exactly synonymous with the word plan or the word strategize.
- The difference between plan and design is very, very specifically just what it is we are planning.
- You plan a birthday party, you design a web page.

## Summary

Designers came from dividing the responsibilities of an artisan or craftsperson. A designer is basically a planner or strategiser.

They write down or draw the requirements for the product.
