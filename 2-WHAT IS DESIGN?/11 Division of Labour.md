# Division of Labour

## Working as a Web Designer

- his first job was designer and builder of website
- most of the direction came from the client - he was more of a facilitator
- he was a web design facilitator
- his job was to help a group of people get clarity on what they wanted, reach an agreement, and then show them what that would look like before he started building it
- it's more about collecting a shared understanding from a group of people and documenting it and getting everybody to agree on it

### Initial Design Process

- when first designing, he would send off a finished looking page of how he thought the homepage and blog page were going to look and he sent them off to the client
- they might change two or three things (people were less picky)

### Atomic Design

- as projects became more complex, they used Atomic Design
- ref Brad Frost wrote a recent book about this
- instead of designing the whole page - atoms, components, etc.
- atoms - headings in bold? different font sizes? padding on a button?
- components - buttons relate on pop ups
- WHY? you've made all the decisions early on so everything is reusable components

### Jacob's Law

- Jacob Nielsen said people spend most of their time on other websites
- therefore, you want to make everything on your website work as similarly as the average website on the Internet
- e.g. hamburger icon in the top left

### Design Patterns

- ux.stackexchange.com
- to ask specific design problem solutions - what's the correct way or the most used way of doing it
- e.g. Bootstrap - framework for UI

## Division of Labour in Design

### UI designer (component designer)

- on General Electric, you would have a team of people who are working out exactly how the menu item is going to look on all the applications, or how certain icons are going to look and work, and then sharing with the rest of the team

### UX designer

- then on a specific application, there would be a different kind of designer who would work out how these components all fit together and fit onto a page (wireframes)
