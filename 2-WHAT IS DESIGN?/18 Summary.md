# Summary

A designer creates the plan. The requirements. They aren't a rock star who does it all on their own.

There were rock stars, blacksmiths or carpenters. Factory processes made it simple, and we split the job up. Designers were born out of a division of labor.

Designers exist on a production line and need to be able to communicate with the rest of that production line. You can't follow simple processes. You're an innovator. You're creating something that's never been created before, but you still need to report back to your production line.

The larger the team, the more risk averse, the less innovative you need to decide what kind of designer you want to be and how much you want to be a team player on the production line and how much you want to be a rock star innovator.

But you always need to be a little bit of the other one.

Your role on the line in your company isn't anything like the role that someone with the same job title as you in another company has.

If you look online, there are thousands and thousands of posts telling you what the responsibilities of job titles are: UX designer, UI designer - ignore all of them. It's a title, nothing more.

It's up to you to research what a job involves and decide if it's something you want to do. A designer in one company doesn't do the same thing as a designer in another company. The problem with designing in a production line in a corporate, serious, logical office environment is that people aren't logical.

This is where your rock star comes in. People don't choose products for logical reasons. The digital world is the most extreme version of this. Never have we moved so fast around something so visual and so emotional. The most impulsive, irrational and emotionally-fueled mammal in history is a human using the Internet.

And yet, for the most part, we design digital products using logical ideas in industrial or corporate processes. The most emotionally-fueled place mankind has ever made.

And we use the most standardized, logical corporate processes to design for them.

No wonder people hate digital products.
