# Job Titles

## What's UX Design? Wrong Question!

- what the responsibilities of your role are are to look in your job requirements the way that you know what the responsibilities of a prospective job are, are to ask the company what the job involves.
- People are more than welcome to create a job at their company and call it a user experience designer and get them to code if they want.
- If your job title is user experience designer, find out what the requirements of your job are and make sure people know because most people will be guessing and with such an ambiguous job title, they'll be guessing wrong.

## What's UX Design? Nothing! Talk to Your Boss!

Communicating the UX Vision by Martina Schell & James O'Brien

- If you are starting work on a new project as a user experience designer, you need to make sure that your boss and your team have a shared understanding of what that term means, because really it doesn't mean anything.
- ketchup bottle vs. plastic squeeze bottle UI is the shape, UX is the way to get the ketchup out
- makes the point though for glass bottles being superior - so the meme is wrong

## Summary

There is NO definition for the terms User Experience Design or User Experience Designer.

If you work at a company that uses these terms you need to clarify within your team what these terms mean and what the responsibilities of each job are.
