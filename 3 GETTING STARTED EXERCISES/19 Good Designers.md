# Good Designers

So this is the first worksheet I'm going to ask you to fill out throughout this course. And it's called Good Designers.

I want you I know we haven't talked about it yet, but I want you to take your best guess at what makes a good designer or a bad designer and what makes a good design or a bad design.

I've split it into three sections because they might be quite different to you.

What makes a good product design may be a kettle might be quite different to what you think makes a good website design and what makes a good application design.

Maybe look at a mobile application you have on your phone. What makes it good or what makes it bad.

Now, to be totally clear with this worksheet, there aren't any right or wrong answers.

In fact, there's no such thing really as a solid definition of what makes a good designer.

If all good designers all thought and acted the exact same way, they would all make the same products and we would have a much narrower range of design solutions.

And I think it'd be really interesting to share this worksheet with other students because you know what?

They're going to have very, very different answers to you, and some of their answers are going to spark some interesting things in your head, make you really think about design more.

The real reason I want you to document this right from the start of the course is because I want you to come back to it at the very end and see how much your opinions have changed throughout this course.

I really hope to challenge some of your initial thoughts about what makes a good or a bad design.

In fact, in all honesty, if I don't challenge those ideas at all, then the course is a failure.

Really.

My worst nightmare would be that you have an idea of what makes a good and a bad design at the start of the course, and it doesn't change at all by the end of the course.

I'm not going to say that all my ideas are correct, but they should at least challenge you and make you think about it more.

You could write a paragraph or you could write some bullet points, but just the absolute top points of what makes a good product design, what makes a bad product design, what makes a good website design, a bad website, design a good application design and a bad application design.

And for extra points, have a think about what makes a good designer but really, really think this through.

Before you carry on with the course, you're going to think of some really, really important, interesting things here.

And some of these ideas are going to be challenged.
